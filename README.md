# mouse-support
Mouse pointer for JB iOS devices

MouseSupport was created by Lance Fetter (ashikase) and is hosted in his iphone-tweaks googe code project.

Source code at http://code.google.com/p/iphone-tweaks/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FMouseSupport

The new maintainer of MouseSupport is now Matthias Ringwald (mringwal), who added fixes for newer OS versions. 
It is also used by the BTC Mouse & Trackpad tweak to simulate the mouse pointer.
